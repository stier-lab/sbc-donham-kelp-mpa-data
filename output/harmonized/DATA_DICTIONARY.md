## Methodology Notes (audit verified 2026-05-04)

### Sampling unit conventions per program

These were audited directly against the raw data files. Numbers in parentheses are observation counts.

| Program | Taxon | Transect / quadrat area | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PISCO swath | Urchins, lobster, kelp | 60 m² (30 m × 2 m) | No AREA column in raw data; constant by protocol. |
| PISCO fish (UCSB / VRG) | Sheephead | 60 m² seafloor footprint | Counts recorded at vertical levels BOT (29,415) / MID (323) / CNMD (47) / CAN (7); CAN excluded by default; toggle `SHEEPHEAD_BOT_ONLY` available for BOT-only sensitivity. |
| KFM (MBON quad/swath) | Urchins | **1 m² (1982–1984)**, **2 m² (1985+)** | Quad-area changed through time. Density divides by row-level `area` not by the constant `KFM_QUAD_AREA_M2 = 2`. |
| KFM (MBON quad/swath) | Macrocystis | 1 m² (1982-84), 2 m² (1985+ paired-diver), or 10 m² (1996+ paired-diver Macro-specific 5 m x 1 m protocol) | **Pipeline filters to 10 m² subset only** (the modern 1996+ Macro-targeted protocol). MBON's `area = 10` is the paired-diver convention: each row is one diver's 5 m² half-quad, and the CountA + CountB pair = 10 m². See Davis et al. 1997 KFM Handbook Vol 1 pp.13, 38. |
| KFM (MBON quad/swath) | Lobster (P. interruptus) | 40 m² (1983-1984), 60 m² (1985+) | Davis et al. 1997 p.39: 1983-84 used 10 transects/site at 2 m × 20 m. 1985-present uses 12 transects/site at 3 m × 20 m. Density divides by row-level `area`, so the temporal change is handled correctly. KFM does not record lobster sizes, so KFM contributes density only, no biomass. |
| KFM (MBON fish file) | Sheephead | Visual Fish Transect (since 1985, transect length 100 m -> 50 m in 1996) + Roving Diver Fish Count (RDFC, since 1996, not 2003) | KFM does not record fish sizes, so KFM contributes density only, no biomass. Per Davis et al. 1997 p.45-48. |
| LTER fish | Sheephead | **80 m² (40 m × 2 m, "BIG fish" protocol)** | LTER survey actually uses two transect sizes: 80 m² for big mobile fish, 20 m² for cryptic small fish. Sheephead is uniformly on 80 m². Cryptic fish are not in this analysis. Defensive check at runtime warns if SPUL transect area ever changes. |
| LTER lobster | Lobster | 300 m² (60 m × 5 m, 2012+) | Constant by protocol (verified). |
| LTER kelp | Macrocystis | 20 or 40 m² | Density normalization uses row-level `AREA`. LTER stores stipe counts in the `FRONDS` column. Per Li (LTER), fronds = stipes for this purpose. |
| Landsat (Bell/SBC LTER) | Macrocystis (canopy biomass only) | Per-MPA polygon | Annual values are **MAX** (peak) kelp canopy biomass within the year, in kg wet weight. Wide format: one row per MPA × status × replicate, one column per year (1984–2021). |

### Size-frequency pool composition (`data/ALL_sizefreq_2024.csv`)

The size-frequency pool that drives biomass bootstrapping was audited against the file's `method` column on 2026-05-04. **The urchin and lobster size pools are PISCO-only.** Method-code coverage:

- `SBTL_SIZEFREQ_PISCO`: PISCO UCSB measurements
- `SBTL_SIZEFREQ_VRG`: PISCO VRG measurements
- `SBTL_SWATH`: direct-on-swath measurements (lobster, UCSB protocol)
- `SBTL_SIZEFREQ_KFM`: present as a code but **0 observations** for urchins or lobster in the current 2024 release
- `SBTL_SIZEFREQ_LTER`: present as a code but **0 observations** for urchins

Urchin pool by method (MESFRA + STRPUR):

| Method | Observations |
|---|---|
| SBTL_SIZEFREQ_PISCO (UCSB) | 3,848 |
| SBTL_SIZEFREQ_VRG | 16,810 |
| SBTL_SIZEFREQ_KFM | 0 |
| SBTL_SIZEFREQ_LTER | 0 |

Lobster pool by method (PANINT):

| Method | Observations |
|---|---|
| SBTL_SIZEFREQ_PISCO (UCSB) | 122 |
| SBTL_SIZEFREQ_VRG | 1,940 |
| SBTL_SWATH (direct on transect, UCSB) | 2,109 |

**Implication:** KFM and LTER urchin biomass estimates rely on PISCO size data via cross-program bootstrap. KFM does collect its own urchin size-frequency data (~200 individuals per species per site per year since 1985, per Davis et al. 1997 p.28). Those records are not in `ALL_sizefreq_2024.csv` but are publicly available for the period 1985-2007 via NOAA ERDDAP at `https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/erdCinpKfmSFNH` (dataset "Channel Islands, Kelp Forest Monitoring, Size and Frequency, Natural Habitat, 1985-2007"). Post-2007 KFM size-frequency data require direct request from the NPS Channel Islands KFM program. Adding these data to `ALL_sizefreq_2024.csv` under method = `SBTL_SIZEFREQ_KFM` would strengthen the urchin biomass estimates from cross-program bootstrap to within-program estimation. This is a known future-work item, deferred for the current manuscript.

### Allometric biomass conversions

| Function | Used for | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `bio_lobster()` | Lobster CL (mm) → biomass (g) | SBC LTER allometric calibration (cf. Barsky 2001, CDFG) |
| `bio_redurch()` | Red urchin diameter (mm) → biomass (g) | SBC LTER allometric calibration (cf. Ebert 2010) |
| `bio_purpurch()` | Purple urchin diameter (mm) → biomass (g) | SBC LTER allometric calibration (cf. Ebert 2010) |
| `bio_sheephead()` / `apply_sheephead_allometry()` | Sheephead TL (cm) to individual mass (g), multiplied by size-class count | Hamilton & Caselle (2015), Methods p. 2, DOI 10.1098/rspb.2014.1817; W = 0.0144 TL^3.04 in PISCO and LTER |
| `bio_macro()` | Macrocystis stipe count → biomass (g) | Mean of six site-specific slopes from SBC LTER kelp allometry, **fit to May–October survey data only** (the LTER canopy-biomass calibration period). |

Sheephead biomass is only available from PISCO (size data) and LTER (size data). KFM lacks fish sizes and contributes density only.

### MPA exclusion lists

Maintained in `01_utils.R`:

- **`EXCLUDED_MPAS`**: MPAs excluded entirely (Carrington Point SMR, Anacapa Island SMR 1978 [pre-MLPA protection], etc.).
- **`EXCLUDED_LTER_SITES` / `EXCLUDED_LTER_SITE_CODES`**: Arroyo Hondo (AHND / a-l-02). Excluded because the site does not meet kelp-forest habitat criteria. It is dominated by surfgrass / sand with sparse, ephemeral kelp coverage and lacks a persistent giant-kelp forest community. Updated 2026-04 from earlier "data quality" framing.
- **`EXCLUDED_REFERENCE_SITES`**: 16 PISCO reference sites flagged by Emily during the 2026-04 review (e.g., ANACAPA_BLACK_SEA_BASS, SMI_PRINCE_ISLAND_*).
- **`EXCLUDED_KFM_SITES`**: 14 KFM transects within the Anacapa Island 1978 SMR boundary, excluded to prevent pre-MLPA protection from confounding the MLPA-era before/after analysis.
- **`SHEEPHEAD_ONLY_MPAS`**: 11 MPAs with sheephead-only data. Removed from cross-taxa pooled analyses to prevent over-representation, selectively re-included for sheephead-targeted analyses via `reinclude_sheephead_mpas()`.
- **`SHEEPHEAD_REINCLUSION_MPAS`** (updated 2026-04): MPAs whose regulations actually protect sheephead (no take of finfish), so the MPA functions like an SMR from sheephead's perspective. Final list is **Blue Cavern Onshore SMCA, Farnsworth Onshore SMCA, Swamis SMCA, Long Point SMR**. Dana Point SMCA and Cat Harbor SMCA were removed (Dana Point permits take of lobster, finfish, and urchins; Cat Harbor permits commercial take of lobster and urchin and recreational take of finfish).

### Proportion-based lnRR (non-standard)

This pipeline computes lnRR on **proportions of time-series maxima**, not on raw means. The proportion is the value at year *t* divided by the maximum within the source-specific MPA × taxon processing group, with inside-MPA and reference observations kept on the same scaling basis. The small zero-correction is group-specific (`adaptive` mode = half the minimum non-zero proportion within the group, `fixed` mode = +0.01 for sensitivity). This non-standard approach standardizes across programs that use different transect areas, survey methods, and spatial extents, at the cost of giving up an absolute-scale lnRR. The choice is invariant to multiplicative scaling within a group, which is why the KFM urchin quad-area fix has zero impact on response ratios (response ratios are unchanged even though absolute densities are now correct for 1982–1984).

### Sheephead level filter (PISCO fish, audit 2026-05-04)

Distribution of all fish-level codes in the PISCO fish file: BOT (359,695) / MID (104,438) / CNMD (10,856) / CAN (42,120). For sheephead specifically: BOT (29,415) / MID (323) / CNMD (47) / CAN (7). The pipeline default is `SHEEPHEAD_BOT_ONLY = FALSE` (BOT/MID/CNMD summed; CAN excluded), which captures sheephead in the water column. Switch to `TRUE` for BOT-only (Hamilton replication / sensitivity).

### Notes

- **lnRR interpretation:** Positive lnDiff = higher abundance inside MPA. lnDiff = 0 means no MPA effect. `exp(lnDiff)` gives the response ratio (e.g., lnDiff = 0.69 means MPA site has ~2× the reference site value).
- **Time = 0:** Implementation year. Years before are negative, years after are positive.
- **Sources:** PISCO = Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans. KFM = NPS Kelp Forest Monitoring (delivered through MBON synthesis). LTER = Santa Barbara Coastal LTER. Landsat = Bell/SBC LTER kelp-watch satellite product.
